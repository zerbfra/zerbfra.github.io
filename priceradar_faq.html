        <h4>Why PriceRadar</h4>
        <p>Amazon's products are often subjected to price variations, either up or down: for this reason, you can select for every product a target price and get a push notification when the price drops!<p>
        <h4>How it works?</h4>
        <p>When our systems identify a price lower than the price you desire for a product, they send a notification to your device, so you can istantly purchase the item and save money.</p>
        <h4>Do I need an Amazon account?</h4>
        <p>It's not necessary to have an Amazon account, you can track the items that you like anyway. The app works on all items available on Amazon's worldwide stores.</p>

      <h3>Wish List importer</h3>
      <h4>Find Amazon Wish List link</h4>
      <p>To find the correct wish list url, open the official Amazon app and from the menu select "Your Wish List".</p><p> Then tap on the "List Action" button on the top right and select "Share". Select "Copy" from the share menu and paste it in the PriceRadar wishlist field.</p>
      <h4>I can't import my wish list</h4>
      <p>Ensure that you've copied the correct wish list link from the official Amazon app or from the website. Make sure that your wishlist is set to public. </p><p>If you still have troubles, please contact the developer from the app with details about your wish list.</p>
